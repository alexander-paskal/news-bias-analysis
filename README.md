# news-bias-analysis
## An analysis of bias in the News, particularly focused on CNN vs Fox reporting during the early Trump era. 

### introduction

Some people read only from certain news sources, but each news source has its own biases.
We hope to reveal such biases for notable news outlets such as CNN and Fox News.
Our goal is to make readers appreciate the biases in the different news articles and to be appropriately skeptical.
