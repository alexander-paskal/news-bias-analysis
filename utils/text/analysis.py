"""
Functions for performing analysis on text.

-All functions should be "pure" i.e. no side effects
-The first argument should be a string containing the text body
-All hyperparameters should be given default parameters corresponding to the most common use case
-Any dependencies introduced for performing these analyses should be restricted to just this module,
 and not found anywhere else in the project
- This module should not depend on anything else in the project, and should work for any arbitrary text
- Make sure to annotate any 'helper' functions with an underscore. If there are too many helpers for one function,
  define a helper class and wrap the class with a function call
